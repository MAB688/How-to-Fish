## **Steps**

### 1. Prepare and organize your gear
- Visit a local tackle shop to purchase gear and receive advice
- Spool the fishing line onto your reel 
    - Tackle shops can do this for you
- Pack tackle based on the body of water and species of fish you are targeting
- Dress appropriately

### 2. Locate a body of water that contains fish
- A creek, river, or lake will all work
- Make sure the location is **not on private property**
- Reference the [PA Fish and Boat Commission](https://www.fishandboat.com/Locate/Pages/MapResources.aspx) for research

### 3. Travel to the body of water
- Dusk and dawn are the best times to fish
- Fish from the shore, carefully wade in, or use a boat

### 4. Find a suitable fishing spot
- Most fish tend to prefer shade or hiding within underwater structures
- **CAUTION: ensure you have enough clearance to swing the fishing rod safely**
- Be prepared to switch fishing spots if you are not catching any fish

### 5. Assemble your gear
- Connect all sections of your fishing rod so that the eyes form a straight line
- Place the fishing reel in the rod's cleat facing downward and tighten
- Run the fishing line through all eyes of the rod
- Attach a lure or hook and bait by using a [**clinch knot**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gz_w9IaV1A)
    - **WARNING: hooks are sharp**

### 6. Cast
- Hold the fishing line to the rod above the reel seating
- Flip the reel's bail open
- Swing the rod backwards and release the line on the forward swing
- Flip the reel's bail closed

### 7. Wait or reel the line in
- If using bait and a bobber: 
    - Let the bait sit and watch the tip of your rod for any unusual movement
- If using a lure:
    - Attempt to emulate the movement of the appropriate insect/fish/vertebrate
- If you do not feel a fish tugging on the line repeat *step 6* otherwise proceed to *step 7*

### 8. Set the hook and reel the fish in
- Pull the rod upwards in one rapid motion to securely hook the fish
- Reel the fish in *as fast as safely possible* to avoid unnecessary stress for the fish
    - If the fish continues to pull out line, tighten your drag or wait for the fish to tire
    - If your rod begins to bend uncontrollably, release some line to reduce the bend

### 9. Land the fish 
- Use a net to scoop up the fish or **wet your hands from the body of water** before touching the fish 
    - **WARNING: fish have sharp fins**
- Quickly and delicately remove the hook from the fish's mouth using hemostats or your hands
    - If the hook has been swallowed, clip the line as close as possible to the hook
- Swiftly release the fish by placing it back in the water
